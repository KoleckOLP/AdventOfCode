# AdventOfCode2020
my solutions to https://adventofcode.com/

Mainly trying to finish the 2020 one, but probably will not be able to do it before the next one starts. (I didn't managed to do a week.)

if you see input files called (kali), they were my friends and I used the because I was far too scared to login for myself.

I thought if you fail the task you can't continue or something.

Now I have my own login Lol. :)

I did most of these in python because the language is really easy and I really liked it.<br>
But now I will be doing the in ruby because I tried the language and I want to use it :)
